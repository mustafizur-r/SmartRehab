A man walks forward with unsteady, shaking steps. The man advances with legs that swing unpredictably, each stride veering slightly off course. His body trembles with every movement, revealing instability and a lack of coordination. The steps are irregular and shaky, giving the impression of fragile balance and difficulty maintaining steady control while walking.
