A man walks with toes pointed downward, lifting his knees high each step. # The man raises his knees sharply as he moves, feet hanging with toes pointed toward the ground. Each step looks exaggerated, as if he must lift his legs higher than normal to avoid stumbling. His gait shows clear difficulty in raising the front of his feet, creating an awkward, high-stepping motion that signals impaired control. #268
