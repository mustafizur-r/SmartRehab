A man with right hemiplegia from a stroke walks slowly. # His right leg swings forward in a wide arc from the outside, with the knee kept straight. His right ankle is stiff, and his toes point downwards (foot drop) and often catch on the ground. His right arm tends to be held rigidly with the elbow bent. His balance is unstable. #268
