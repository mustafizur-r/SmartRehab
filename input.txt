A person walks forward with a hemiplegic gait. The affected leg remains stiff with limited knee flexion during swing, causing the leg to move outward in a semicircular path. The foot is plantarflexed with reduced heel strike, and the toes may lightly drag the floor. The trunk leans slightly toward the unaffected side for balance, and arm swing is asymmetric, with the affected arm held in a flexed posture.
