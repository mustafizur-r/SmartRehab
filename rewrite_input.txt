The person stands upright and raises the right hand smoothly above the head, keeping the arm extended and the posture balanced. # The individual initiates forward motion with a right hip hike and delayed left heel strike, demonstrating asymmetric weight-bearing. Right limb stance phase shows excessive hip abduction, limited knee extension, and equinus, necessitating circumduction during swing phase. The right foot clears the ground with compensatory trunk lean to the left, while the left lower extremity exhibits normal kinematics. Gait rhythm is uneven, with prolonged right stance and reduced step length, requiring intermittent right hand support for balance. Pelvic tilt and trunk rotation persist throughout, reflecting impaired balance control and asymmetric propulsion. #268
